    <h2>NBA Park Arduino Library</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">R&D on projects | Present</p>
    <hr class="sep-hr2">
    <p>
        Worked as a programmer on projects for Arduino-controlled attractions throughout the theme park, building experiences
        focusing on <b>game feedback</b> and <b>maintainability</b>. Here are the attractions where the library was used:
    </p>
    <div id="nbapark-inner-projects">
        <h3><i class="bi bi-dribbble"> </i>R-Battle</h3>
        <p>
            Tabletop basketball game using remotely controlled tanks, with matches up to 4 players. I programmed the game
            logic, addressable LEDs, IR sensors on the "baskets" to count each scored point, the content on the TFT display,
            and a button for interaction and configuration.
        </p>

        <h3><i class="bi bi-dribbble"> </i>MVP Competion</h3>
        <p>
            Pop-a-shot-like game where players compete for the highest score, having three hoops to make shots, where a 
            projection shows which one is active for scoring. I programmed the game and integration logic with the projection 
            mapping software, using OSC protocol for information exchange between the microcontroller and the computer running
            the projections, as well as US sensors attached to the hoops to count scored points.

    <h2>IR with Inverted Index & ATM SIM</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Google's C++ Education Course | December 2024</p>
    <hr class="sep-hr2">
    <p>
        The <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/c++/cpp-in-depth#how-google-works" target="_blank">course's final project</a>
        is to build a search engine by creating an Inverted Index data structure from text documents, providing a command-line
        UI for query input and search result display, while the previous was an <b>ATM Simulator</b>, both illustrating <i>I/O and OO</i>
        design in C++ and project structuring. By requiring multiple files, write a hash table from scratch and perform dynamic
        memory allocation, those projects helped me better understand the <b>C/C++ build process</b> and <b>memory management</b>
        as a whole, while also giving me plenty of room to explore tools like <b>Make</b> and <b>GDB</b>, which I was curious to
        learn at the time.

    <h2>Pygame Ghouls 'n Ghosts</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">CS50P's Final Project | July 2024</p>
    <hr class="sep-hr2">
    <p>
        A 2D arcade-style game inspired by <i>Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts</i>, featuring a leaderboard system that stores the top ten
        highest scores and the names of the players who achieved them. This project pushed me into prototyping and implementing
        game mechanics, such as score and stat tracking systems, collisions, enemy behaviors, dynamic item and weapon systems,
        player leveling, game balancing, customizable controls, and UI. The game can be downloaded on
        <a href="https://nazuma.itch.io/pygame-ghouls-n-ghosts" target="_blank">Itch.io</a>.
