                    I'm an aspiring game developer, currently diving into CS fundamental concepts like operating systems,
                    and low-level programming, primarily studying with C and C++.

            I consider myself an optimistic and enthusiastic person. I love learning new things and facing challenges, always trying
            to see what I can take away from each experience to build further knowledge and grow to become a top-level engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nowadays, at <a href="https://www.nbaparkgramado.com.br/" target="_blank">NBA Park</a>, I find myself really enjoying
            working with <b>microcontrollers</b> and <b>embedded projects</b> (which has its own rabbit hole that sparked my curiosity), leading
            me to learn more about communication protocols, optimization strategies, and resource management. All of this and the
            <b>R&D</b> process of forming and building new project ideas with a team of competent people, combining our strengths
            to deliver great experiences for others, seems to me part of game development projects too, which inspires me to improve
            every day in computer systems engineering.
        </p>
        <h2>Aspirations</h2>
        <p>
            I am eager to join a team in the games industry, where I can collaborate, innovate, and grow as a developer, learning
            from and working with great engineers. I'm confident I'll maintain my passion and commitment to this
            journey because I truly feel like I've found my calling. I want to bring value to the people I work with, the companies
            I contribute to, and the broader industry as a whole.
